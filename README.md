## 1. Executive Summary
A proprietary quantitative trading algorithm engineered for US Equity Index Futures (NQ, YM, ES). Unlike traditional technical strategies, this model relies on **Regime Detection** and **Event-Driven Filtering** to isolate high-probability volatility windows during the NY Session (15:00 - 16:30 EST).

> *"Alpha is not generated by trading more; it is generated by filtering risk."*

## 3. Algorithmic Architecture
The strategy utilizes a multi-factor decision tree to reject ~85% of trading days, engaging only when statistical expectancy is maximized.

### A. Regime Detection Engine
* **Volatility Filters:** Rejects entries during low-IV environments where gamma risk outweighs potential delta.
* **Trend Alignment:** Utilizes a custom moving-average ribbon to identify mean-reversion vs. momentum regimes.

### B. Event Sensitivity Layer
* **Calendar Filtering:** Automatically neutralizes exposure ahead of FOMC Minutes, CPI releases, and NFP data.
* **Liquidity Adjustments:** Dynamic position sizing during bank holidays to account for slippage risk.

### C. Risk Management Protocol
* **Fixed Fractional Sizing:** Risk strictly capped at 1.0% NAV per trade.
* **Drawdown Breaker:** Hard-stop protocols engage if drawdown exceeds 5%, forcing a reduction in position sizing.
